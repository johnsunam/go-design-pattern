### Creational Pattern: Singleton

#### Purpose
This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to single instance and provides global access

Allows for lazy initializations of class

#### Scenario

Situation where we want to ensure there is only one instance of a class: logging, configuration, telementry, debugging
